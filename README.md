PostgreSQL Database Tools
=========================

The tools in this project are meant to be used in the design, creation and
maintenance of PostgreSQL databases. So this is specifically not meant as a
cross database toolset, because that usually causes compatibility headaches and
multiple partially supported database engines.

Description Format
------------------

One of the main components of the toolset is a database schema description
format. The description format is based on YAML, because it is easy to read and
write for humans.
