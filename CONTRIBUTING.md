## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for pg-db-tools. Following
these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report
:pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer:, and find related
reports :mag_right:.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers
reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details
  as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started pg-db-tools, e.g.
  which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started pg-db-tools
  otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how
  you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to
  files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those
  examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code
  blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point
  out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new
  version of pg-db-tools) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in
  an older version of pg-db-tools?** What's the most recent version in which the
  problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how
  often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of pg-db-tools are you using?** You can get the exact version by
  running the command `db-schema --version` on the command line.
* **What's the PostgreSQL version you're using**?
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
pg-db-tools, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing
functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as
    many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include
  copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code
  blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected
  to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most pg-db-tools users.
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of pg-db-tools you're using.** You can get the exact
  version by running the command `db-schema --version` on the command line.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain pg-db-tools's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible pg-db-tools
- Enable a sustainable system for pg-db-tools's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
